This program is a part of my engineer thesis.
It works with self designed interferometer which performs automatic measurements to determine the temperature dependence of the refractive indices of liquid crystals. The process of determining the change in refractive indices of CK begins by taking a series of images as a function of temperature of the position of the interference striations formed by the interaction of the reference beam and the beam propagating through the liquid crystal layer. Based on this data the determination of the shift of the interference striations, the phase change of the propagating beam is calculated, as well as the change in refractive indices as a function of temperature. By analizing the obtained graph and knowledge of the temperature of the nematic-isotropic liquid phase transition, it is possible to determine the limits of the temperature interval for which the obtained results correspond to the nematic CK phase.
